# Proxy: Head

_Proxy: Head_ is an application that provides a very basic screen to other applications. It's primary focus is to give
people the ability to _quickly_ get visuals out of their program so they can more easily create libraries for graphical
applications without always rewriting the same code for opening windows cross-platform, dropping some pixels in and so on.

## Features

- Displays bitmap graphics via shared memory
- Supports basic mouse and keyboard input
- Supports several graphics formats
  - 16, 24 and 32 bit rgb color formats
  - 8 bit indexed mode
- Flexible head resolution
- User-configurable palette for indexed mode

## Nice to have

These features are not implement, but would be cool to have:

- [ ] Multi-head support
- [ ] Save to screenshot
