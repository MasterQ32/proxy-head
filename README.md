# Proxy: Head

_Proxy: Head_ is an application that provides a very basic screen to other applications. It's primary focus is to give
people the ability to _quickly_ get visuals out of their program so they can more easily create libraries for graphical
applications without always rewriting the same code for opening windows cross-platform, dropping some pixels in and so on.
